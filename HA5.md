Due **Wednesday** Nov 24, 11:59PM

In this assignment we are:

- Engaging with visualization of data types recently discussed in class.
- Gaining familiarity reading and interpreting a flow visualization and
  large-scale contribution.


The artifacts generated should be presented in LaTeX documents.

### Paper Reading (20 pts)

Read the paper "Improved Post Hoc Flow Analysis Via Lagrangian
Representations" by Alexy Agranovsky et al.  Answer the following questions
which are the same as in the previous assignments.


1. What problem is this paper trying to solve?

2. Why is this problem considered a visualization problem?

3. Why is the problem important?

4. How does this paper contribute to solving the problem? 

5. What approaches are used to construct the contributions?

6. How are the contributions of the paper evaluated or justified? 

7. What do you think are this paper's strengths? 

8. What do you think could be improved about this paper?

9. What future directions do the authors suggest? 

10. What future directions not mentioned in the paper would you suggest?

11. What questions do you have about this paper? For example: Were these things
   you find difficult to understand? Are there details left unanswered? Do you
have philosophical questions regarding some of the points made?

12. How might the concepts or approaches in this paper relate to your course
   project? If you have not yet chosen a course project, give your best guess
with what you are thinking of doing now.

Note: These questions have been adapted from similar guides and assignments by
William G.  Griswold, Premkumar Devanbu, and Michelle Strout.

The results should be submitted as a LaTeX `.tex` file that will compile into
a `.pdf` with the command `pdflatex`. Use the template from the previous
assignment. The name of the `.tex` file should be `reading.tex.`

This portion will be graded on whether you have answered all the questions,
including sub-questions, the thoughtfulness of your answers, and the
readability of your answers.


### Short Answer (24 pts)

1. What does x,y-position encode in common approaches to node-link diagrams?
   Explain your answer (4 pts)

2. What is meant by a semantic fisheye view? (4 pts)

3. According to George Furnas, what's the most important design decision when
   choosing between focus+context techniques? (2 pts)

4. Explain a scenario where you would wnat to use a grid map cartogram over a
   geographical map. Justify your explanation with visualization knowledge from
class. (4 pts)

5. What is the difference in how the terms "multidimensional" and
   "multivariate" are typically used? (2 pts)

6. Use Marching Squares (by hand) to draw the isocontours at 9 for the dataset
   [4, 6, 6, 3, 1, 8, 10, 12, 8, 3, 6, 12, 8, 8, 8, 3, 11, 10, 6, 12, 1, 3, 8,
0, 18]  colleced from a 5 x 5 grid. Assume linear interpolation and that the data is
order to horizontal increases first. Your figure should make both the contour
and grid visible, labeling the grid points. (8 pts)
