## Project Presentation

Version History: 

- Released, 2019/11/5


Due November 29, 9:00 AM

In this milestone we are:

- Practicing explaining our research to a broader audience
- Creating artifacts of the project in terms of slides
- Thinking critically about visualization and research design to provide
  feedback


Create a repository for this milestone at this following Github Classroom
link: [https://classroom.github.com/a/hnzs_teZ](https://classroom.github.com/a/hnzs_teZ)


At the deadline, a copy of your slides should be in that repository. You may
make changes to the slides later to improve them for the presentation, but the
artifact at the deadline will be factored into the grading as well. Please
upload as a PDF. If you plan to have movies, please use a static image in the
PDF and link to the movies on Youtube or Google Drive. If you are planning a
live demo, please include a slide that says "Live Demo" and on it describe the
actions you will take during the demonstration including what
features/datasets you will go through and in what order. 

### Presentation

The presentation should be between 12 and 15 minutes for individual projects
and between 15 and 18 minutes for group projects. There will be time for
questions after each presentation. 

In group projects, each team member should present for appropximately equal
time.

The presentation should cover:

- An overview of the problem you are trying to solve and why it is important. Remember, your classmates are probably unfamiliar with it. It is worth taking some time to describe it in detail along with the data if applicable and the goals of your solution. If the audience does not understand the problem you are trying to solve and why it is important, they will not follow the rest of the presentation.

- An overview of your solution including the methods you followed, design
  choices and rationale, and how they solve the problem. If you are doing a
study, you should present preliminary results if you have them. If you are
doing a literature review, you should summarize your
categorization/organization and findings so far.

- Relfections you have upon the project so far, e.g., what would you have liked to
  have known at the beginning of the project? what was surprising? what do you
understand better now? what knowledge would you like to share?


The goals of the presentation are:

- The rest of the class understands your problem and solution enough to offer you constructive criticism
- The rest of the class benefits from the knowledge you gained (about design, visualization, implementation or anything else) by doing this project.


Suggestion on presentation structure: A talk of this length **does not** require
an outline slide. If such a slide works naturally as part of a large point
and/or conveys other information it may be helpful. However, a slide with six
bulleted short phrases is not worth the time. You are short on time in this
presentation, so please use it wisely.

### Presentation Feedback

For each presentation, answer the following questions:

- What is the goal of this project? What problem is it trying to solve and why is that problem important?
- What are the strengths of the solution?
- What in the solution could be improved and how? (Do not repeat what the presenter has already said.) Note in literature survey projects, the "solution" may be the organization, categorization, and presention for the visualization audience. In other words, what could be done to make their analysis more useful for others like yourself?

You will submit these answers in a Google Form to be given on the first day of
presentations.  The answers are all due by 8PM on the day the presentation is
given. I recommend taking notes during the presentation and typing them up
after class OR typing directly into the form. If you do the latter, do not
forget to hit submit!

Your feedback in these forms will be *confidential.* They will be shared with
the teams *without* your name attached. Please be *constructive* in your
feedback. You will be graded individually on your how constructive your
feedback was, including the tone of the feedback.


### Presentation Dates

This class has ten projects. Presentations will be scheduled on November 29th, December 1st,
and December 6th as follows:

TBD in class


### Grading

You will be graded on the following items:

Presentation:

- (25 pts) the inclusion of the content described
- (10 pts) the effectiveness and clarity of conveying that information
- (10 pts) the use of visual aids and spoken word.
- (10 pts) the structure and flow of the presentation: Do the topics and speakers change naturally or is it disjointed? Do people know what they are going to say or do they halt and/or read off the slides? Do presenters speak at a reasonable pace? 
- (10 pts) the quality of the artifact (slides) submitted

Presentation Feedback:

- (35 pts) the completeness and quality of your responses
