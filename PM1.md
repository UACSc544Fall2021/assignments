## Project Milestone 1

Version History: 

- Released, 2021/8/20


Due Thursday September 23, 11:59 PM

In this milestone we are:

- Planning the research project we will do during the semester
- Verifying we have the data and resources needed to complete the project
- Explaining why the project is important and beneficial to the visualization
  community and society at large
- Verifying we can build a more complicated LaTeX file

Github Classroom URL: <a href="https://classroom.github.com/g/fzolNj7E">https://classroom.github.com/g/fzolNj7E</a>

Included with this Github Classroom assignment are the LaTeX files required to
format an IEEE VGTC-style document. You will need to fill in the files
`proposal.tex`, `intro.tex`, `background.tex`, `research.tex`, `impact.tex`,
and `proposal.bib`. You may also need to add figures to the `figs` directory.
Included is a `Makefile` to build the document into a PDF. What you turn in
should build if I type `make` at the command line, resulting in a PDF that I
can review and grade. It is your responsibility to verify that this method of
building the PDF works.

Do not include any auxiliary files (e.g., the already compiled PDF, .bbl,
.out, .DS_Store) not required to build your proposal. You should only include
files needed for this milestone. You may include any files that came with the
assignment.

**Full instructions for how to write the proposal are within the files. Answer
the questions posed therein. Read the contents of those files for further
detail.** Grade breakdowns are also included in the files. It is recommended
you download these files early and read through them. They may give you more
ideas about possible project types.

In the `intro.tex` file, you will briefly describe the problem, the background
necessary to understand the problem, why the problem is important, and how you
plan to address the problem.

In the `background.tex` file, you will go into more detail about the knowledge
necessary to understand the problem. You will also review related work in
solving the problem.

In the `research.tex` file, you will discuss your plan to complete the project
(solve the problem) during the semester. You will include information about
your access to data and resources, your argument for the technology you will
use, and your plans for evaluation along with a timeline which details how the
other project milestones will be applied to your project. 

In the `impact.tex` file, you will discuss what impact solving the problem may
have and what will be learned by the community.

This milestone will be graded on the thoroughness of your proposal as well as
the adherence to format and overall readability. In terms of thoroughness I
will evaluate whether it fills out all the sections reasonably and answers all
the questions given therein.  

**If any subsection is deemed insufficient, you will be asked to resubmit it
in the following milestone.**

Note you should have the general idea of your project verified by me through
an private-to-instructors Piazza post **BEFORE** you turn in this
proposal. If you have not done so, I will not accept the proposal.

#### Project Teams

You may do the project individually or in pairs. If you choose to do the
project with a partner, you are responsible for managing the partnership. The
work is expected to be commensurate with the number of people in the group.

Please let me know of any issues with your partner as soon as possible.


#### Project Types

Projects may include:

- Visualization design studies
- Visualization library/tool (systems) projects
- Controlled user studies evaluating a visualization or perception related to
  visualizations
- Evaluations of visualizations
- Literature surveys
- Replication studies

For other types of projects, please discuss with the instructor over Piazza.

If your project includes human participants outside of your normal
collaborations, you will need to complete CITI training before progressing.
Depending on your plans for this work, you may also need to obtain IRB
approval. Developing the IRB application can be part of your second milestone.

You are welcome to combine or derive this work from your existing research
projects. You are equally welcome to do a completely separate project.

See class slides for more examples.
